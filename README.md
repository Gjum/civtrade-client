# Civtrade Client

[Civtrade](http://civtrade.herokuapp.com/) is a marketplace listing for
[Civcraft](http://reddit.com/r/civcraft). This Minecraft client mod makes it
frictionless to list new shops and will soon make it possible to search for
shops nearby and add waypoints to them.

# Installing

This mod depends on [Forge][2]. I recommend using [MagicLauncher][1] to manage
client mods.

1. Download the zip archive and put it somewhere permanent
2. Enter you MagicLauncher config profile setup and add the zip to mods
3. Launch Minecraft and verify Civtrade is listed in your mods

Otherwise, you probably know the drill:

1. Unzip your minecraft.jar
2. Drop in the contents of the Civtrade zip archive
3. Repackage minecraft.jar
4. ???
5. PROFIT

# Usage

Listing a new shop is easy. Just right-click on the shop's sign, just like
you're making a purchase. Having the currency in hand is not required.

None of your personal information, in-game username or anything else is
collected.  Just the x, y, z of the shop and the information the sign shows.

## For example

![A PhysicalShop selling coal](http://f.cl.ly/items/1J2i110f2c3m1w3u3m2e/2013-06-05_10.38.17.png)

Right-clicking this sign will produce one of [these listings][3].

# Future Features

* In game "shops nearby" searching.
* Shop inventory information being collected
